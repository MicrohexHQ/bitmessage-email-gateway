Subject: Paid account expired, payment required

It looks like your paid account expired.

If you would like to continue as a paid account, please send

${btcamount} bitcoins
to ${btcaddress}

${btcuri}

If you do not pay, your account will continue to be serviced as a free account, without any of the advanced features available with paid acccounts. You will not be able to send emails, receive attachments or charge for incoming emails.
